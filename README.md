# ArduinoQueueLibrary

Certainly! Here's an example of how you could structure the Overview and Usage sections for the documentation of your Arduino Queue Library:

### Overview
The QueueLibraryForArduino is a user-friendly, efficient library designed for Arduino projects requiring queue data structure implementation. It offers a straightforward approach to managing data in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) manner. This library is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to store and retrieve data sequentially, such as in sensor data buffering, task scheduling, or in any application where data must be processed in the order it was received.

### Usage
To use the QueueLibraryForArduino in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: First, download the library and include it in your Arduino IDE.

2. **Initialization**: Create an instance of the queue. You can specify the data type and the maximum size of the queue. 
   ```cpp
   #include <QueueLibraryForArduino.h>
   Queue<int> myQueue(10); // Create a queue of integers with a maximum size of 10
   ```

3. **Enqueueing Data**: Add items to the queue using the `enqueue` method.
   ```cpp
   myQueue.enqueue(5); // Add the number 5 to the queue
   ```

4. **Dequeueing Data**: Remove items from the queue with `dequeue`. This returns the item at the front of the queue and removes it.
   ```cpp
   int frontItem = myQueue.dequeue(); // Removes and returns the front item from the queue
   ```

5. **Peek**: To view the item at the front of the queue without removing it, use `peek`.
   ```cpp
   int front = myQueue.peek(); // Returns the front item without removing it
   ```

6. **Checking Queue Status**: You can check if the queue is empty or full with `isEmpty()` and `isFull()` respectively.
   ```cpp
   if (myQueue.isEmpty()) {
       // Queue is empty
   }
   ```

Remember to handle cases where the queue might be full before enqueueing or empty before dequeueing to avoid any runtime errors.
